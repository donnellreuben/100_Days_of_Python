I am signing up for Replit's 100 days of Python 
challenge!
I will make sure to spend some time every day coding
along, for a minimum of 10 minutes a day. 
I'll be using Replit, an amazing online IDE so I can do 
this from my phone wherever I happen to be. No excuses
fro not coding from the middle of a field!
